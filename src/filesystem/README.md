# Filesystem MCP Server

Node.js server implementing Model Context Protocol (MCP) for filesystem operations.

## Features

- Read/write files
- Create/list/delete directories
- Move files/directories
- Search files
- Get file metadata
- Dynamic directory access control via [Roots](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/learn/client-concepts#roots)

## Directory Access Control

The server uses a flexible directory access control system. Directories can be specified via command-line arguments or dynamically via [Roots](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/learn/client-concepts#roots).

### Method 1: Command-line Arguments
Specify Allowed directories when starting the server:
```bash
mcp-server-filesystem /path/to/dir1 /path/to/dir2
```

### Method 2: MCP Roots (Recommended)
MCP clients that support [Roots](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/learn/client-concepts#roots) can dynamically update the Allowed directories. 

Roots notified by Client to Server, completely replace any server-side Allowed directories when provided.

**Important**: If server starts without command-line arguments AND client doesn't support roots protocol (or provides empty roots), the server will throw an error during initialization.

This is the recommended method, as this enables runtime directory updates via `roots/list_changed` notifications without server restart, providing a more flexible and modern integration experience.

### How It Works

The server's directory access control follows this flow:

1. **Server Startup**
   - Server starts with directories from command-line arguments (if provided)
   - If no arguments provided, server starts with empty allowed directories

2. **Client Connection & Initialization**
   - Client connects and sends `initialize` request with capabilities
   - Server checks if client supports roots protocol (`capabilities.roots`)
   
3. **Roots Protocol Handling** (if client supports roots)
   - **On initialization**: Server requests roots from client via `roots/list`
   - Client responds with its configured roots
   - Server replaces ALL allowed directories with client's roots
   - **On runtime updates**: Client can send `notifications/roots/list_changed`
   - Server requests updated roots and replaces allowed directories again

4. **Fallback Behavior** (if client doesn't support roots)
   - Server continues using command-line directories only
   - No dynamic updates possible

5. **Access Control**
   - All filesystem operations are restricted to allowed directories
   - Use `list_allowed_directories` tool to see current directories
   - Server requires at least ONE allowed directory to operate

**Note**: The server will only allow operations within directories specified either via `args` or via Roots.

### Tool annotations (MCP hints)

This server sets [MCP ToolAnnotations](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/server/tools#toolannotations)
on each tool so clients can:

- Distinguish **read‑only** tools from write‑capable tools.
- Understand which write operations are **idempotent** (safe to retry with the same arguments).
- Highlight operations that may be **destructive** (overwriting or heavily mutating data).

The mapping for filesystem tools is:

| Tool                        | readOnlyHint | idempotentHint | destructiveHint | Notes                                            |

> Note: `idempotentHint` and `destructiveHint` are meaningful only when `readOnlyHint` is `false`, as defined by the MCP spec.

## Usage with Claude Desktop
Add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

Note: you can provide sandboxed directories to the server by mounting them to `/projects`. Adding the `ro` flag will make the directory readonly by the server.
# Installing the Filesystem MCP Server for Claude Desktop on Windows

Getting Claude Desktop to interact with your local files opens up powerful workflows for document analysis, code review, and file management. This guide walks you through setting up the Filesystem MCP (Model Context Protocol) server on Windows, including a common fix for connection issues.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- Claude Desktop installed on your Windows machine
- Node.js installed (download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) if needed)
- Administrator access to your computer

## Step 1: Fix the Roaming Directory Issue

Many Windows users encounter server connection errors or file sourcing problems because of how Windows handles the AppData\Roaming directory with npx. To prevent this, create the npx cache directory manually before configuring anything.

Open Command Prompt and run:

```cmd
mkdir C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\npx
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual Windows username. You can find this by opening File Explorer and navigating to `C:\Users\` to see your username folder.

## Step 2: Locate the Claude Desktop Configuration File

The configuration file lives at:

```
C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
```

If the file doesn't exist, you can create it. If it does exist, you'll be editing it.

## Step 3: Update the Configuration

Open `claude_desktop_config.json` in a text editor (Notepad works fine) and add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "C:/Program Files/nodejs/npx.cmd",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
        "C:\\Users\\YOUR_USERNAME\\Desktop",
        "C:\\Users\\YOUR_USERNAME\\Downloads"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

A few important notes about this configuration:

- The `command` path uses forward slashes, which works correctly on Windows
- The `args` paths use escaped backslashes (`\\`) as required for JSON strings
- The `-y` flag automatically confirms the npx package installation
- You can add or remove directory paths in the args array to control which folders Claude can access

Adjust the paths to match your username and whichever directories you want Claude to be able to read and write.

## Step 4: Fully Restart Claude Desktop

This step is critical. Don't just close the window—you need to completely quit the application:

1. Right-click the Claude icon in your system tray (bottom-right corner of your taskbar)
2. Select "Quit" or "Exit"
3. Wait a few seconds
4. Relaunch Claude Desktop

A simple window close won't reload the configuration. The full restart ensures Claude reads the updated config file.

## Step 5: Verify the Server is Running

Once Claude Desktop opens without errors:

1. Click on the **Settings** menu (gear icon or via the menu)
2. Navigate to **Developer**
3. Look for the **filesystem** server in the list
4. Confirm it shows as running (typically indicated by a green status or "connected" label)

If you see errors here, double-check your configuration file for JSON syntax errors (missing commas, brackets, or quote marks are common culprits).

## Step 6: Configure the Connector

With the server running, you now need to enable the connector:

1. Go to **Settings > Connectors**
2. Find the **filesystem** connector in the list
3. Click to configure or enable it
4. Save your changes

## Step 7: Confirm Everything Works

Start a new conversation in Claude Desktop. You should now see a small plug or hammer icon in the input area. Click it to open the tools modal—the filesystem connector should appear in the list of available tools.

Try asking Claude something like "What files are on my Desktop?" to verify the connection is working properly.

## Troubleshooting

**Server won't start or shows connection errors**

- Verify Node.js is installed by running `node --version` in Command Prompt
- Confirm the npx.cmd path matches your Node.js installation location
- Make sure you created the Roaming\npx directory from Step 1

**JSON parsing errors**

- Validate your JSON at [jsonlint.com](https://jsonlint.com)
- Check for trailing commas (not allowed in JSON)
- Ensure all paths use either forward slashes or escaped backslashes

**Filesystem connector not appearing**

- Restart Claude Desktop completely (quit from system tray)
- Check Developer settings to confirm the server is running
- Verify the connector is enabled in Settings > Connectors

**Permission denied errors**

- Make sure the directories you specified in the config actually exist
- Check that your Windows user has read/write permissions for those folders

## Customizing Your Setup

You can grant Claude access to additional directories by adding more paths to the args array:

```json
"args": [
  "-y",
  "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
  "C:\\Users\\YOUR_USERNAME\\Desktop",
  "C:\\Users\\YOUR_USERNAME\\Downloads",
  "C:\\Users\\YOUR_USERNAME\\Documents",
  "D:\\Projects"
]
```

Be thoughtful about which directories you expose. Limiting access to specific folders you actually need keeps things more secure and prevents accidental modifications to system files.

## Conclusion

With the Filesystem MCP server configured, Claude Desktop can now help you manage files, analyze documents, review code, and automate file-based tasks directly on your Windows machine. The initial setup takes a few minutes, but once configured, it opens up a much more integrated workflow.

For manual installation, you can configure the MCP server using one of these methods:

**Method 1: User Configuration (Recommended)**
Add the configuration to your user-level MCP configuration file. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl + Shift + P`) and run `MCP: Open User Configuration`. This will open your user `mcp.json` file where you can add the server configuration.

**Method 2: Workspace Configuration**
Alternatively, you can add the configuration to a file called `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace. This will allow you to share the configuration with others.

> For more details about MCP configuration in VS Code, see the [official VS Code MCP documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/mcp-servers).

You can provide sandboxed directories to the server by mounting them to `/projects`. Adding the `ro` flag will make the directory readonly by the server.
