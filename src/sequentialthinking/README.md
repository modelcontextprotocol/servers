### 6. `auto_think` ‚ú® NEW
**Autonomous thought generation using MCP sampling for self-driven reasoning.**

Leverages Claude's reasoning capabilities through MCP sampling to:
- Analyze current thought history and identify next logical steps
- Generate intelligent, contextually-aware thoughts automatically
- Auto-enhance thoughts with confidence, tags, evidence, and references
- Continue iteratively until problem resolution or max iterations reached

**Inputs:**
- `maxIterations` (integer, 1-10, default: 3): Maximum autonomous thoughts to generate

**Key Features:**
- **Smart Context Analysis**: Analyzes problem domains, confidence gaps, and reasoning chains
- **Intelligent Prompting**: Generates contextual prompts based on thought history and gaps
- **Auto-Enhancement**: Automatically estimates confidence, extracts evidence, adds tags
- **Reference Detection**: Identifies connections to previous thoughts
- **Adaptive Stopping**: Recognizes completion signals or continuation needs

**Requirements:**
- At least one manual thought must exist first
- MCP client must support sampling functionality

## üöÄ Usage Scenarios

### Enhanced Problem-Solving
- **Complex Architecture Decisions**: Track trade-offs with confidence levels and evidence
- **Systematic Debugging**: Document hypothesis testing with evidence chains

## üí° Quick Start Examples

### Basic Enhanced Thinking
```json
{
  "thought": "Initial analysis suggests API-first approach",
  "thoughtNumber": 1,
  "totalThoughts": 5,
  "nextThoughtNeeded": true,
  "tags": ["architecture", "api-design"],
  "confidence": 0.7,
  "evidence": ["Team has API expertise", "Faster mobile development"]
}
```

### Building References
```json
{
  "thought": "Building on thoughts 2 and 4, the security model needs revision",
  "thoughtNumber": 6,
  "references": [2, 4],
  "tags": ["architecture", "security"],
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "evidence": ["Recent security audit findings"]
}
```

### Search and Synthesis
```json
// Search thoughts
{"query": "security", "tags": ["architecture"]}

// Generate synthesis
{} // No parameters needed - analyzes all thoughts
```

### Autonomous Thinking ‚ú® NEW
```json
// Start with a manual thought
{
  "thought": "Need to optimize our API response times for mobile users",
  "thoughtNumber": 1,
  "totalThoughts": 3,
  "nextThoughtNeeded": true,
  "tags": ["performance", "api"],
  "confidence": 0.6,
  "evidence": ["Mobile users report 2-3 second delays"]
}

// Let the server continue thinking autonomously
{"maxIterations": 4}
```

**Auto-Think will:**
1. Analyze the performance/API context
2. Generate logical next steps (caching, database optimization, etc.)
3. Auto-enhance with confidence scores and evidence
4. Continue until reaching a solution or max iterations
5. Return complete thought chain with synthesis

## Configuration

### Usage with Claude Desktop

Add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

#### npx

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### docker

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequentialthinking": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "mcp/sequentialthinking"

For manual installation, you can configure the MCP server using one of these methods:

**Method 1: User Configuration (Recommended)**
Add the configuration to your user-level MCP configuration file. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl + Shift + P`) and run `MCP: Open User Configuration`. This will open your user `mcp.json` file where you can add the server configuration.

**Method 2: Workspace Configuration**
Alternatively, you can add the configuration to a file called `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace. This will allow you to share the configuration with others.

> For more details about MCP configuration in VS Code, see the [official VS Code MCP documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/mcp).
