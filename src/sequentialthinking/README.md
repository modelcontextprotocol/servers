  "thought": "Building on thoughts 2 and 4, the security model needs revision",
  "thoughtNumber": 6,
  "references": [2, 4],
  "tags": ["architecture", "security"],
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "evidence": ["Recent security audit findings"]
}
```

### Search and Synthesis
```json
// Search thoughts
{"query": "security", "tags": ["architecture"]}

// Generate synthesis

For manual installation, you can configure the MCP server using one of these methods:

**Method 1: User Configuration (Recommended)**
Add the configuration to your user-level MCP configuration file. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl + Shift + P`) and run `MCP: Open User Configuration`. This will open your user `mcp.json` file where you can add the server configuration.

**Method 2: Workspace Configuration**
Alternatively, you can add the configuration to a file called `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace. This will allow you to share the configuration with others.

> For more details about MCP configuration in VS Code, see the [official VS Code MCP documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/mcp).

For NPX installation:

```json
{
  "servers": {
