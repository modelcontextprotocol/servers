## Demo 5: Pattern-guided Problem Solving Workflow

**Scenario**: Legacy database performance optimization guided by extracted patterns.

### Pattern-Guided Approach

The demo started by retrieving relevant patterns:

```json
{
  "tool": "get_pattern_recommendations",
  "parameters": {
    "domains": ["strategy", "technical"],
    "keywords": ["database", "performance", "optimization", "architecture"],
    "complexity": "medium"
  }
}
```

**Pattern Recommendation Response:**
```json
{
  "topRecommendations": [
    {
      "pattern": {
        "name": "technical-evidence-based-pattern",
        "approach": "evidence-based",
        "successRate": 0.86
      },
      "matchConfidence": 0.3,
      "adaptationSuggestions": [
        "Adjust for medium complexity (pattern is for low)",
        "Key success factors: high-confidence-reasoning, evidence-backed-reasoning"
      ],
      "thoughtSequence": [
        {
          "stepType": "analysis",
          "expectedConfidence": 0.8,
          "keyTags": ["technical", "architecture", "performance"]
        },
        {
          "stepType": "exploration", 
          "expectedConfidence": 0.85,
          "keyTags": ["technical", "system-design", "optimization"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Evidence-based Problem Solving

Following the pattern guidance, the analysis proceeded systematically:

**Phase 1: Problem Analysis** (Confidence: 0.8)
- Current performance: 3-5 second response times (target: <500ms)
- 50,000+ concurrent users experiencing bottlenecks
- Single MySQL instance with limited indexing, no caching layer

**Phase 2: Solution Exploration** (Confidence: 0.85)
```sql
-- Database Performance Profiling Query
-- Identifies top performance bottlenecks

-- Query execution time analysis
SELECT 
    query_time,
    lock_time,
    rows_examined,
    rows_sent,
    query_text
FROM mysql.slow_log 
WHERE query_time > 1.0
ORDER BY query_time DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Missing index identification
SELECT 
    table_schema,
    table_name,
    column_name,
    cardinality,
    index_type
FROM information_schema.statistics
WHERE table_schema = 'production_db'
  AND cardinality < 100
ORDER BY cardinality ASC;
