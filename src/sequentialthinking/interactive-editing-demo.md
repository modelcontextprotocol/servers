## Advanced Use Cases

### 1. Collaborative Editing Workflow

**Team-based Thought Refinement:**
```json
// Initial architect thought
{
  "thought": "Consider microservices vs monolith architecture",
  "thoughtNumber": 1,
  "confidence": 0.5,
  "userId": "senior-architect"
}

// Security team input
{
  "thoughtNumber": 1,
  "evidence": ["Security boundaries easier with microservices"],
  "assumptions": ["Security team can manage distributed auth"],
  "reason": "Security team review and input",
  "userId": "security-lead"
}

// Performance team validation
{
  "thoughtNumber": 1,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "evidence": [...previous, "Load testing confirms scalability benefits"],
  "reason": "Performance validation complete",
  "userId": "performance-engineer"
}
```

### 2. Iterative Research Development

**Research Thought Evolution:**
```json
// Stage 1: Initial hypothesis
{
  "thought": "Algorithm X might be optimal for this use case",
  "confidence": 0.3,
  "assumptions": ["Performance requirements are as specified"]
}

// Stage 2: Literature review
{
  "thoughtNumber": 1,
  "evidence": ["Paper Y shows 40% improvement", "Implementation Z achieved similar results"],
  "confidence": 0.6,
  "reason": "Literature review findings incorporated"
}

// Stage 3: Experimental validation  
{
  "thoughtNumber": 1,
  "thought": "VALIDATED: Algorithm X is optimal for this use case with 45% performance improvement",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "evidence": [...previous, "Our experiments confirm 45% improvement", "Statistical significance p<0.001"],
  "reason": "Experimental validation complete"
}
```

### 3. Quality Improvement Process

**Thought Refinement Workflow:**
```json
// Initial draft
{
  "thought": "System needs better caching",
  "confidence": 0.4,
  "tags": ["performance", "draft"]
}

// Research and analysis
{
  "thoughtNumber": 1,
  "thought": "System requires distributed caching layer with Redis Cluster for optimal performance",
  "confidence": 0.7,
  "evidence": ["Current cache hit rate only 45%", "Redis Cluster handles 100K+ ops/sec"],
  "tags": ["performance", "caching", "redis", "analyzed"],
  "reason": "Added specific technology recommendation and performance data"
}

// Peer review and validation
{
  "thoughtNumber": 1,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "evidence": [...previous, "Peer review confirms approach", "Similar implementation successful at Company X"],
  "tags": [...previous, "peer-reviewed", "validated"],
  "reason": "Peer review complete and approach validated"
}
```

## Error Handling

### Common Error Scenarios

  "error": "Failed to edit thought: Thought 5 not found",
  "details": "Please provide thoughtNumber and at least one field to edit"
}
```

**No Changes Detected:**
```json
{
  "thoughtNumber": 1,
  "status": "no_changes", 
  "message": "No changes detected. Thought remains unchanged.",
  "currentThought": { /* current thought data */ }
}
```

**Invalid Parameters:**
```json
{
  "error": "Failed to edit thought: Invalid thoughtNumber: must be a number",
  "details": "Please provide thoughtNumber and at least one field to edit"
}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. **Meaningful Edit Reasons**
Always provide clear reasons for edits to maintain useful audit trails:

```json
{
  "reason": "Updated based on stakeholder feedback from architecture review meeting"
}
```

### 2. **Incremental Confidence Updates**
Update confidence levels as evidence accumulates:

```json
{
  "confidence": 0.6, // Start conservative
  "reason": "Initial analysis complete"
}

{
  "confidence": 0.8, // Increase with evidence
  "reason": "Validation testing confirms approach"
}
```

### 3. **Structured Evidence Addition**
Add evidence systematically:

```json
{
  "evidence": [
    "Literature review: 3 papers support approach",
    "Industry examples: Netflix, Uber use similar patterns", 
    "Performance testing: 40% improvement measured",
    "Team assessment: Implementation feasible in 6 weeks"
  ]
}
```

### 4. **Tag Evolution**
Update tags as thoughts mature:

```json
{
  "tags": ["draft", "architecture"] // Initial
}

{
  "tags": ["reviewed", "architecture", "validated"] // After review
}

{
  "tags": ["approved", "architecture", "validated", "implementation-ready"] // Final
}
```

The Interactive Thought Editing system provides a complete solution for collaborative, iterative reasoning with full accountability and traceability. It supports both individual thought refinement and team-based collaborative thinking with comprehensive change tracking and audit capabilities.
