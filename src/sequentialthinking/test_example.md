# Fixed Autonomous Thinking - Test Example

The autonomous thinking feature has been fixed and now works with both MCP sampling and a fallback rule-based system.

## What Was Fixed

1. **MCP Sampling Implementation**: 
   - Replaced `server.request()` with `server.createMessage()` - the correct MCP SDK method
   - Added sampling capability declaration to server capabilities
   - Added proper client capability checking

2. **Fallback Implementation**:
   - Created rule-based autonomous thinking when MCP sampling is not available
   - Uses predefined reasoning patterns for different types of follow-up analysis
   - Applies contextual tagging, evidence extraction, and reference linking

## Example Usage

### Step 1: Add Initial Manual Thought
```json
{
  "tool": "sequentialthinking",
  "arguments": {
    "thought": "I need to optimize the database query performance for our e-commerce platform. Current page loads are taking 3-5 seconds during peak traffic, which is causing customer frustration.",
    "thoughtNumber": 1,
    "totalThoughts": 3,
    "nextThoughtNeeded": true,
    "tags": ["database", "optimization", "performance"],
    "confidence": 0.7,
    "evidence": ["User complaints about slow loading", "Analytics showing 3-5 second page loads", "Peak traffic correlation with slowdowns"]
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Use Autonomous Thinking
```json
{
  "tool": "auto_think",
  "arguments": {
    "maxIterations": 3
  }
}
```

## Expected Results

**With MCP Sampling Support:**
- Intelligent, context-aware follow-up thoughts generated by LLM
- Automatic confidence estimation and metadata enhancement
- Dynamic stopping based on content analysis

**Without MCP Sampling (Fallback):**
- Structured rule-based follow-up thoughts covering:
  - Assumption analysis
  - Alternative approaches
  - Risk assessment  
  - Evidence evaluation
  - Synthesis and insights
- Heuristic-based tagging and reference linking
- Contextual thought selection based on current state

## Key Improvements

1. **Always Works**: No longer fails with "Method not found" errors
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Automatically detects MCP sampling capability and falls back appropriately
3. **Better Error Messages**: Clear indication of whether sampling is available or fallback mode is being used
4. **Contextual Intelligence**: Both modes generate relevant follow-up thoughts based on current thinking state

The autonomous thinking feature is now robust and will work in any MCP environment, whether or not the client supports sampling.
