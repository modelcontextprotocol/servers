## Installation

### Using uv (recommended)

When using [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) no specific installation is needed. We will
use [`uvx`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) to directly run *mcp-server-git*.

### Using PIP

Alternatively you can install `mcp-server-git` via pip:

```
pip install mcp-server-git
```

After installation, you can run it as a script using:

```
python -m mcp_server_git
```

## Configuration

### Usage with Claude Desktop

Add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

<details>
<summary>Using uvx</summary>

```json

  "git": {
    "command": "uvx",
    "args": ["mcp-server-git", "--repository", "path/to/git/repo"]
  }
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Using docker</summary>

* Note: replace '/Users/username' with the a path that you want to be accessible by this tool

```json

For manual installation, you can configure the MCP server using one of these methods:

**Method 1: User Configuration (Recommended)**
Add the configuration to your user-level MCP configuration file. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl + Shift + P`) and run `MCP: Open User Configuration`. This will open your user `mcp.json` file where you can add the server configuration.

**Method 2: Workspace Configuration**
Alternatively, you can add the configuration to a file called `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace. This will allow you to share the configuration with others.

> For more details about MCP configuration in VS Code, see the [official VS Code MCP documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/mcp).

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "git": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-git"]
    }
  }
}
```

For Docker installation:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "git": {
        "command": "docker",
        "args": [
          "run",
          "--rm",
          "-i",
          "--mount", "type=bind,src=${workspaceFolder},dst=/workspace",
          "mcp/git"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Usage with [Zed](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed)

Add to your Zed settings.json:

<details>
<summary>Using uvx</summary>

```json
"context_servers": [
  "mcp-server-git": {
    "command": {
      "path": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-git"]
    }
  }
],
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Using pip installation</summary>

```json
"context_servers": {
  "mcp-server-git": {
    "command": {
      "path": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "mcp_server_git"]
    }
  }
},
```
</details>

### Usage with [Zencoder](https://zencoder.ai)

1. Go to the Zencoder menu (...)
2. From the dropdown menu, select `Agent Tools`
3. Click on the `Add Custom MCP`
4. Add the name (i.e. git) and server configuration from below, and make sure to hit the `Install` button

<details>
<summary>Using uvx</summary>

```json
{
    "command": "uvx",
    "args": ["mcp-server-git", "--repository", "path/to/git/repo"]
}
```
</details>

## Debugging

You can use the MCP inspector to debug the server. For uvx installations:

```
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uvx mcp-server-git
```

Or if you've installed the package in a specific directory or are developing on it:

```
cd path/to/servers/src/git
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv run mcp-server-git
```

Running `tail -n 20 -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log` will show the logs from the server and may
help you debug any issues.

## Development

If you are doing local development, there are two ways to test your changes:

1. Run the MCP inspector to test your changes. See [Debugging](#debugging) for run instructions.

2. Test using the Claude desktop app. Add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

### Docker

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "git": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "--mount", "type=bind,src=/Users/username/Desktop,dst=/projects/Desktop",
        "--mount", "type=bind,src=/path/to/other/allowed/dir,dst=/projects/other/allowed/dir,ro",
        "--mount", "type=bind,src=/path/to/file.txt,dst=/projects/path/to/file.txt",
        "mcp/git"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### UVX
```json
{
"mcpServers": {
  "git": {
    "command": "uv",
    "args": [
      "--directory",
      "/<path to mcp-servers>/mcp-servers/src/git",
      "run",
      "mcp-server-git"
    ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Build

Docker build:

```bash
cd src/git
docker build -t mcp/git .
```
