## Enhanced Features Implemented

### Intelligent Problem Analysis
```typescript
// Automatic domain detection from problem content
private detectDomain(problem: string): string
// Complexity assessment based on multiple factors  
private assessComplexity(problem: string): 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'extreme'
// Mode selection based on problem characteristics
```

### Smart Tagging System
- **Context-Aware**: Tags based on problem domain, phase, and content
- **Confidence-Based**: Automatic confidence level tagging
- **Type Detection**: Hypothesis, evidence, conclusion, alternative analysis
- **Domain-Specific**: Architecture, debugging, research specialized tags

### Confidence-Driven Branching
```typescript
private shouldBranch(currentThought: string, thoughtNumber: number): {
  shouldBranch: boolean;
  branchReason: string;
  branchId?: string;
  alternatives: string[];
}
```

**Branching Triggers**:
- Low confidence (< 40%)
- Decision point detection
- Complexity management
- Alternative exploration needs

### Automatic Synthesis
```typescript
private shouldSynthesize(thoughtNumber: number): SynthesisPoint | null
```

**Synthesis Triggers**:
- Regular intervals for complex problems
- Phase transitions
- Confidence threshold achievements
- User-requested consolidation

### Reference Building
- **Explicit References**: Direct thought number citations
- **Implicit References**: Context-based connection detection
- **Conceptual Links**: Theme and domain-based relationships
- **Evidence Chains**: Supporting argument linkages

## Advanced Capabilities

### Multi-Modal Analysis
The agent adapts its reasoning approach based on problem type:

- **Architecture Mode**: System design patterns, trade-off analysis, scalability focus
- **Debugging Mode**: Evidence gathering, hypothesis testing, root cause analysis  
- **Research Mode**: Literature synthesis, validation planning, comprehensive evidence
- **General Mode**: Flexible reasoning with domain-adaptive strategies

### Phase Management
Structured progression through reasoning phases:
1. **Analysis**: Problem decomposition and understanding
2. **Exploration**: Alternative investigation and evidence gathering
3. **Synthesis**: Insight combination and pattern recognition
4. **Validation**: Solution testing and verification
5. **Conclusion**: Final recommendations and next steps

### Evidence Tracking
Comprehensive evidence organization:
```typescript
private evidenceTracker: Map<string, number[]> = new Map();
```

Tracks supporting evidence by category with thought number references for complete traceability.
