# Debugging Session Example

This example shows how the DeepThink Agent enhances debugging with evidence tracking, hypothesis testing, and systematic investigation.

## Problem: Intermittent Application Crashes

**Initial Problem**: A Node.js application crashes intermittently under load with no clear error logs. The crashes happen about every 2-3 hours during peak traffic.

## Session Flow

### 1. Initialize Debug Analysis

```json
{
  "tool": "deepthink_analyze",
  "arguments": {
    "problem": "Node.js application crashes intermittently under load every 2-3 hours during peak traffic with no clear error logs",
    "mode": "debugging",
    "evidence_level": "exhaustive"
  }
}
```

**Agent Response:**
```json
{
  "context": {
    "mode": "debugging",
    "domain": "debugging",
    "complexity": "high", 
    "currentPhase": "analysis",
    "confidence": 0.4,
    "evidenceLevel": "exhaustive"
  },
  "enhanced_thought": {
    "tags": ["analysis", "debugging", "intermittent-issue", "nodejs", "memory-leak", "low-confidence"],
    "confidence": 0.4
  }
}
```

### 2. Evidence Gathering Phase

```json
{
  "tool": "deepthink_continue",
  "arguments": {
    "thought": "Intermittent crashes with no clear logs suggest either memory leaks, unhandled promise rejections, or resource exhaustion. The 2-3 hour pattern indicates gradual accumulation rather than immediate triggers. Need to gather evidence: memory usage patterns, process monitoring, and enhanced logging.",
    "thought_number": 2
  }
}
```

**Agent Response:**
```json
{
  "enhanced_thought": {
    "tags": ["analysis", "debugging", "evidence", "memory-leak", "promise-rejection", "resource-exhaustion"],
    "references": [1],
    "confidence": 0.5
  }
}
```

### 3. Hypothesis Formation - Branching Triggered

```json
{
  "tool": "deepthink_continue",
  "arguments": {
    "thought": "Primary hypotheses: 1) Memory leak in request handling causing OOM kills, 2) Unhandled promise rejections accumulating, 3) Database connection pool exhaustion, 4) Event loop blocking. Each requires different investigation approaches.",
    "thought_number": 3
  }
}
```

**Agent Response:**
```json
{
  "enhanced_thought": {
    "tags": ["analysis", "debugging", "hypothesis", "memory-leak", "promise-rejection", "database", "event-loop"],
    "branchFromThought": 3,
    "branchId": "hypothesis-exploration-3"
  },
  "branching_suggestion": {
    "recommended": true,
    "reason": "low-confidence-exploration",
    "alternatives": [
      "memory-leak-investigation",
      "promise-handling-analysis", 
      "database-connection-analysis"
    ]
  }
}
```

### 4. Branch A: Memory Leak Investigation

```json
{
  "tool": "deepthink_continue",
  "arguments": {
    "thought": "Branch A - Memory Investigation: Add heap monitoring with `process.memoryUsage()` logging every minute. Look for growing heapUsed over time. Also enable Node.js --max-old-space-size monitoring and heap snapshots before crashes. Common leak sources: closures retaining DOM/objects, event listeners not cleaned up, caching without bounds.",
    "thought_number": 4
  }
}
```

**Agent Response:**
```json
{
  "enhanced_thought": {
    "tags": ["exploration", "debugging", "memory-leak", "heap-monitoring", "nodejs", "evidence"],
    "branchId": "hypothesis-exploration-3",
    "references": [3],
    "confidence": 0.6
  }
}
```

### 5. Branch B: Promise Handling Analysis

```json
{
  "tool": "deepthink_continue",
  "arguments": {
    "thought": "Branch B - Promise Investigation: Unhandled promise rejections can crash Node.js apps. Add `process.on('unhandledRejection')` and `process.on('uncaughtException')` handlers with detailed logging. Review async/await usage and .catch() handlers throughout codebase. Focus on database queries and external API calls.",
    "thought_number": 5
  }
}
```

**Agent Response:**
```json
{
  "enhanced_thought": {
    "tags": ["exploration", "debugging", "promise-rejection", "async-await", "error-handling", "evidence"],
    "branchId": "hypothesis-exploration-3", 
    "references": [3],
    "confidence": 0.7
  }
}
```

### 6. Evidence Collection Results

```json
{
  "tool": "deepthink_continue",
  "arguments": {
    "thought": "Evidence collected: Heap usage grows from 50MB to 400MB over 2 hours, then crash. Found 15 unhandled promise rejections in logs, mostly from database timeout errors during high load. Database connection pool shows 'connection limit reached' warnings. This points to a combined issue: connection leaks causing promise rejections.",
    "thought_number": 6
  }
}
```

**Agent Response:**
```json
{
  "enhanced_thought": {
    "tags": ["evidence", "debugging", "memory-leak", "connection-leak", "database", "high-confidence"],
    "references": [4, 5],
    "confidence": 0.8
  },
  "context_update": {
    "currentPhase": "exploration",
    "confidence": 0.8
  }
}
```

### 7. Root Cause Analysis - Synthesis Point

```json
{
  "tool": "deepthink_continue", 
  "arguments": {
    "thought": "Root cause identified: Database queries during high load timeout but connections aren't properly released due to missing .finally() blocks in promise chains. Leaked connections accumulate until pool exhaustion, causing cascading failures and memory growth from queued requests. The 2-3 hour pattern matches connection pool limit (100 connections) divided by leak rate (~1 connection per minute under load).",
    "thought_number": 7
  }
}
```

**Agent Response:**
```json
{
  "enhanced_thought": {
    "tags": ["synthesis", "debugging", "root-cause", "connection-leak", "database", "high-confidence"],
    "references": [6, 4, 5],
    "confidence": 0.9
  },
  "synthesis_opportunity": {
    "type": "convergent", 
    "thoughts_to_synthesize": [4, 5, 6],
    "confidence_threshold": 0.8
  },
  "context_update": {
    "currentPhase": "synthesis",
    "confidence": 0.9
  }
}
```

### 8. Solution Design

```json
{
  "tool": "deepthink_continue",
  "arguments": {
    "thought": "Solution: 1) Add proper .finally() blocks to all database queries to ensure connection release, 2) Implement connection pool monitoring with alerts, 3) Add circuit breaker pattern for database calls during high load, 4) Set shorter query timeouts (5s instead of 30s), 5) Add graceful degradation when connection pool is near capacity.",
    "thought_number": 8
  }
}
```

**Agent Response:**
```json
{
  "enhanced_thought": {
    "tags": ["synthesis", "debugging", "solution", "circuit-breaker", "connection-management"],
    "references": [7],
    "confidence": 0.85
  }
}
```

### 9. Validation Testing

```json
{
  "tool": "deepthink_continue",
  "arguments": {
    "thought": "Validation plan: 1) Load testing with connection leak monitoring to confirm fix, 2) Deliberate timeout injection to test connection release, 3) Extended soak testing (24+ hours) to verify no memory growth, 4) Monitoring setup for production deployment with connection pool metrics and heap size tracking.",
    "thought_number": 9
  }
}
```

**Agent Response:**
```json
{
  "enhanced_thought": {
    "tags": ["validation", "debugging", "testing", "monitoring", "production"],
    "references": [8],
    "confidence": 0.9
  },
  "context_update": {
    "currentPhase": "validation"
  }
}
```

### 10. Implementation Checklist

```json
{
  "tool": "deepthink_continue",
  "arguments": {
    "thought": "Implementation checklist: ✅ Add .finally() to 23 database query locations, ✅ Implement connection pool monitoring dashboard, ✅ Add circuit breaker with 70% pool capacity threshold, ✅ Reduce query timeout to 5s, ✅ Add unhandledRejection logging, ✅ Set up heap monitoring alerts, ✅ Create runbook for connection pool issues.",
    "thought_number": 10
  }
}
```

## Key Debugging Benefits Demonstrated

1. **Systematic Investigation**: Structured approach from symptoms to root cause
2. **Evidence-Based Analysis**: Tracked multiple data points and correlated findings  
3. **Hypothesis Testing**: Explored multiple potential causes through branching
4. **Confidence-Driven Exploration**: Low initial confidence triggered comprehensive investigation
5. **Root Cause Synthesis**: Combined evidence from multiple branches to identify true cause
6. **Solution Validation**: Planned comprehensive testing to verify fix
7. **Implementation Guidance**: Provided specific checklist and monitoring setup

## Results

The DeepThink Agent guided a systematic debugging process that:
- Identified the root cause (database connection leaks)
- Provided specific technical solutions
- Created validation and testing plans
- Established ongoing monitoring strategies
- Built institutional knowledge through detailed evidence tracking

This demonstrates how the agent enhances debugging by maintaining systematic investigation patterns, tracking evidence across multiple hypotheses, and ensuring thorough validation of solutions.
