  }
}
```

### 5. Conflicting Evidence - Branching Triggered

```json
{
  "tool": "deepthink_continue",
  "arguments": {
    "thought": "Contradictory findings emerge: some studies show significant productivity gains (Google's 2023 internal study: 22% increase), others show decline (IBM's return-to-office study citing 18% productivity drop remote). This suggests the answer depends heavily on implementation quality, company culture, and measurement methodology. Need to branch into different contextual factors.",

  "tool": "deepthink_continue",
  "arguments": {
    "thought": "Branch A - Culture Analysis: Companies with strong async communication cultures (GitLab, Automattic, Buffer) report sustained 20-25% productivity gains. Key factors: documentation-first culture, clear async communication protocols, outcome-based performance metrics rather than time-based. Contrasts with companies forcing synchronous remote work (constant video calls) showing productivity decline.",

```json
{
  "tool": "deepthink_continue",
  "arguments": {
    "thought": "Branch B - Methodology Analysis: Studies using narrow metrics (lines of code, hours worked) show different results than those using holistic measures (feature delivery, bug reduction, developer satisfaction). The 'productivity paradox': individual output metrics increase but system-level velocity may decrease due to coordination overhead. Many studies conflate correlation with causation.",

{
  "tool": "deepthink_continue",
  "arguments": {
    "thought": "Developing framework: Remote work productivity depends on three key dimensions: 1) Implementation Quality (async practices, tools, management training), 2) Individual Factors (home setup, self-discipline, communication skills), 3) Team Dynamics (culture, collaboration patterns, knowledge sharing). High performance in all three correlates with 20-30% productivity gains; weakness in any area leads to 10-20% decline.",

}
```

### 10. Hypothesis Formulation

```json
{
  "tool": "deepthink_continue",
  "arguments": {
    "thought": "Primary hypothesis: Remote work impact on developer productivity follows a capability maturity model. Organizations with mature remote practices (Level 4-5: optimized async processes, strong documentation culture, outcome-based metrics) see significant gains. Those applying in-office practices to remote settings (Level 1-2) see decline. The transition period (6-18 months) is critical for building remote-specific capabilities.",
    "thought_number": 10
  }
}
```

**Agent Response:**
```json
{
  "enhanced_thought": {
    "tags": ["hypothesis", "research", "maturity-model", "capability-development", "transition-period"],
    "references": [9],
    "confidence": 0.8
  }
}
```

### 11. Validation Approach

```json
{
  "tool": "deepthink_continue",
  "arguments": {
    "thought": "Validation strategy: 1) Longitudinal analysis of companies pre/post remote transition with capability maturity scoring, 2) Survey of 500+ developers across different company maturity levels, 3) Case study comparison of high-performing remote teams vs struggling ones, 4) Meta-analysis of existing studies controlling for methodology differences. Expect to find strong correlation between remote maturity and productivity outcomes.",
    "thought_number": 11
  }
}
```

**Agent Response:**
```json
{
  "enhanced_thought": {
    "tags": ["validation", "research", "longitudinal-analysis", "meta-analysis", "case-studies"],

```

### 12. Research Conclusions

```json
{
  "tool": "deepthink_continue",
  "arguments": {
    "thought": "Research conclusion: Remote work's impact on developer productivity is not binary but contextual. Well-implemented remote work (with proper async practices, tools, and culture) increases productivity 15-25%. Poorly implemented remote work (forcing synchronous patterns, inadequate tools, micromanagement) decreases productivity 10-20%. The key insight: it's not remote vs in-office, but mature vs immature remote work practices that determines outcomes.",
    "thought_number": 12
  }
}
```

**Agent Response:**
```json
{
  "enhanced_thought": {
    "tags": ["conclusion", "research", "contextual-impact", "implementation-quality", "mature-practices"],
    "references": [11],
    "confidence": 0.9
